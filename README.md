# Build-A-Game #3
A project where Omiya Games develops a game suggested by the twitch.tv/techvalleygamespace commentors live.  You can see his chronicles archived here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz-l93sVz9_2y2j-Xkcjx8CGr__zTNe-

#Story suggestions:

1. you're a cybernetic cat who performs surgery on mice and can interact with multiple species due to some AI implants that your human masters had once implanted, but the AI develops a consciousness and tries to convince you to kill the mice instead of saving them
2. you're searching for life on Saturn's moon but only find pieces of life that was once. The clues hint at a collapsed civilization you are were once a garbage collection machine
