Landed on Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. Beginning research on life...

I'm a cat. Meow. Humans has instructed to venture into this dangerous mission.

Today, I have reported my progress through my brain-implant chip, using the latest machine language innovation, auto-cat-to-human-translater! Report should have around a 1.3 hour lag.

Growl. Mice is giving me a hard time. The bored ones keep spinning in their cage. The feeble test subjects aren't very good at landing on their feet, however. Cute.

I get that the mice enjoy the lower gravity, but that's no excuse for being impatient. I'm meow considering using sedatives.

Operation on first mouse is a success. The sedatives have really done their job. Confirmed no abnormalities on organs when experimental chips were implanted.

After pawtchwork, each mice are meow running in circles again. Got half of them operated already. So annoying. So...tasty-looking. They would go well will catnip and a side of salmon.

Last cat nap, I had a dream. The humans were commanding me to eat the mice. "No!" I screamed, "the mice is a vital part of the experiment. Plus, I take no commands from you lowly humans!"

Paw is shaking. Had difficulties finishing the operation on the last mice. Every organ looked so delicious. Humans came back to meow, letting meow know my machine language brain-implant chip learned to make my inner demons appear in my dreams. Had it temporarily disabled during this operation.

Mission investigating Enceladus ends. Initiating sequence back to home planet, Mars...
