Landed on Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons. Beginning research on life...

First week of investigating these waters yielded no sign of life. It is early, but already, I have a sinking about this mission.

Found a single crushed soda can this week. This is unexpected. Entire crew ran through sterilization procedures to verify nothing came out of this submarine.

This is getting crazy. Only a few hours earlier, we discover a pile of plastic bottles. The crew has already investigated potential cause, but we are certain these artifacts are not coming from our submarine.

We've followed a trail of cans, bottles and soggy cardboard, and to our disbelief, we encountered an underwater. This shouldn't be! Nobody should have arrived to Enceladus before us!

I woke up last night with a cold-sweat. It was of a garbage collection operation, where we were tasked to launch them out of space. The smell...was overwhelming.

A crew member pointed out a strange, monstrous shadow behind one of the hills. When we drove closer, we found a tractor. How...?

The dreams were getting worse. Initially, the garbage was supposed to be launched into space, but due to mismanagement, they were thrown underwater. The tractors moving the garbage resembled the one we found just yesterday.

Crew member got the internet working earlier. Despite the 1.3 hours delay, we learned that perhaps we were not the first to arrive at Enceladus. A now defunct garbage collection company may have landed, and not only illegaly deposited their waste, but also performed memory wiping on all individuals involved.

Mission investigating Enceladus ends. Initiating sequence back to home planet, Mars...
