        <b>Controls:</b>


        * Left or right arrow keys to steer.


        * Hold the down arrow key to slow down.


        * Hold the up arrow key to use turbo (requires fuel).


        * Tap the space bar while on the ground to hop.


        * Hold the space bar while in the air to dive.


        * While on the ground, hold the space bar, then hold left or right to initiate
        a drift. When the white curve emit from the corner of the vehicle, you may
        let go of the arrow key to continue drifting; arrow keys can now be used to
        adjust the angle of the drift.


        <b>Tips:</b>


        * If you end up off-track, a timer will appear to indicate how long you have
        before the game over screen appears.


        * Drifting and flying in the air charges the turbo fuel.


        * When off-track, use the turbo fuel and dive to return back to safety!'
